# Microsoft Intune Autopilot Deployment & Implementation


This project presents a detailed plan for deploying Microsoft Intune Autopilot, followed by the implementation of several Intune features aimed at improving device management, security, and operational efficiency within an organization. The main goal is to automate the provisioning of new devices via Autopilot, streamlining setup and pre-configuration, and then integrating key features like Windows Update Management, Endpoint Analytics, BitLocker Management, and Office 365 deployment. The project is structured into distinct phases: initiation, planning, preparation, deployment, post-deployment configuration, testing, and closure. Each phase includes specific deliverables.

# Prerequisites
